# Calling Agents

There are multiple ways to interact with agents created using Mastra. Below you will find examples of how to call agents using workflow steps, tools, the [Mastra Client SDK](../../docs/server-db/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli-client.mdx), and the command line for quick local testing.

This page demonstrates how to call the `harryPotterAgent` described in the [Changing the System Prompt](./system-prompt.mdx) example.

## From a workflow step

The `@actus-ag/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli` instance is passed as an argument to a workflow step’s `execute` function. It provides access to registered agents using `getAgent()`. Use this method to retrieve your agent, then call `generate()` with a prompt.

```typescript filename="src/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/cli/cli/cli/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  // ...
  execute: async ({ @@mastra/cli/cli/cli }) => {

    const agent = @@mastra/cli/cli/cli.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
    const response = await agent.generate("What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?");

    console.log(response.text);
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  // ...
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## From a tool

The `@actus-ag/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli` instance is available within a tool’s `execute` function. Use `getAgent()` to retrieve a registered agent and call `generate()` with a prompt.

```typescript filename="src/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/cli/cli/cli/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const testTool = createTool({
  // ...
  execute: async ({ @@mastra/cli/cli/cli }) => {

    const agent = @@mastra/cli/cli/cli.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
    const response = await agent.generate("What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?");

    console.log(response!.text);
  }
});
```

## From Mastra Client

The `@@mastra/cli/cli/cliClient` instance provides access to registered agents. Use `getAgent()` to retrieve an agent and call `generate()` with an object containing a `messages` array of role/content pairs.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { @@mastra/cli/cli/cliClient } from "../lib/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli-client";

const agent = @@mastra/cli/cli/cliClient.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
const response = await agent.generate({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?"
    }
  ]
});

console.log(response.text);
```

> See [Mastra Client SDK](../../docs/server-db/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli-client.mdx) for more information.

## From the command line

You can create a simple script to test your agent locally. The `@actus-ag/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli` instance provides access to registered agents using `getAgent()`.

To ensure your model has access to environment variables (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`), install `dotenv` and import it at the top of your script.

```typescript filename="src/test-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import "dotenv/config";

import { @@mastra/cli/cli/cli } from "./@@mastra/cli/cli/cli";

const agent = @@mastra/cli/cli/cli.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
const response = await agent.generate("What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?");

console.log(response.text);
```

Run this script from your command line using:

```bash
npx tsx src/test-agent.ts
```

## From curl

You can interact with a registered agent by sending a `POST` request to your Mastra application's `/generate` endpoint. Include a `messages` array of role/content pairs.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/harryPotterAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?"
      }
    ]
  }'| jq -r '.text'
```
