# NetlifyDeployer

The `NetlifyDeployer` class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Netlify. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](/reference/deployer/deployer) class with Netlify specific functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript filename="src/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/cli/cli/cli/core/@@mastra/cli/cli/cli";
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/cli/cli/cli/deployer-netlify";

export const @@mastra/cli/cli/cli = new Mastra({
  // ...
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer()
});
```
